    <p>For many companies, communication between managers, employees, and volunteers has become a problem; oftentimes, there is a miscommunication and loss of information, especially between volunteer recruiters and volunteers. For companies who work off a volunteer basis, it can often be difficult to reach out to various volunteers even after communication is established. When recruiting new volunteers, sometimes volunteer recruiters may miss crucial information such as phone numbers, job titles, etc.; mishandled information can lead to loss of contact with volunteers, a crucial part to any organization/company.</p>

    <p class="fadeIn">My application is called Daizzy, taken from its original concept name: a combination of the initial developers first letter of their first name. Daizzy is a chatbot designed to ask users questions and schedule them for volunteer dates; these questions include name, volunteer role, and date, modifiable by the company. After answering all of Daizzy’s questions, inputted information is immediately sent to a remote database where it is then stored and ready to access. If a user decides to change their volunteer role or schedule date, they simply re-enter their name when prompted and Daizzy will automatically recognize their profile and bring up their registered information, from there, users can modify their initially inputted data. Daizzy also has an embedded Google Calendar synced with the company’s volunteer recruiter account pertaining to all possible sign up dates; this helps users better visualize and choose a date to volunteer for or receive training.

    <p class="fadeIn">Other ideas already developed, were software used on the company's side to organize already inputted data by the volunteer; these softwares however did not address the initial interaction between the volunteer and company, which was how the volunteer inputted information; the key aspect every software lacked, was an immersive user experience—the ticket to retaining more volunteers; users would have the same experience as filling out a form while missing the one-to-one connection they’d receive through call. Daizzy is fast, efficient, and immersive, making everything automatic while providing new volunteers a great first experience. Removing the hassles of online forms and inaccuracy of over the phone scheduling, my application is a simple solution to a growing problem. With improvements in even user to computer interactions, companies will have peace of mind in contacting new volunteers saving them both time and money.</p>

    <p class="fadeIn">Using script editing programs like Sublime Text 3 and terminal software such as Git, I rebuilt a much more efficient and reliable universal chatbot that would help any company organize their volunteers. For those who may be foreign to computer programming, everything starts off as a blank page. Imagine a fresh Word document, from there, lines of codes are added to first build a structure, then aesthetics, and finally functionality. The main components of my application include a conversational chatbot, embedded calendars, user recognition, and database storage. Each chunk was built from scratch mainly using JavaScript requiring both knowledge on front and back-end coding; only the web languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AWS were used</p>
